NAME
----
xs - Crossroads I/O, a lightweight messaging layer


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <xs.h>*

*cc* ['flags'] 'files' *-lxs* ['libraries']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Crossroads I/O is a library which extends the standard
socket interfaces with features traditionally provided by specialised
_messaging middleware_ products. Crossroads sockets provide an abstraction of
asynchronous  _message queues_, multiple _messaging patterns_, message
filtering (_subscriptions_), seamless access to multiple _transport protocols_
and more.

This documentation presents an overview of Crossroads concepts, describes how
Crossroads abstract standard sockets and provides a reference manual for the
functions provided by the Crossroads library.


Context
~~~~~~~
Before using any Crossroads library functions the caller must initialise a
'context' using _xs_init()_. The following functions are provided to handle
initialisation and termination of a 'context':

Initialise Crossroads context::
    linkxs:xs_init[3]

Terminate Crossroads context::
    linkxs:xs_term[3]


Thread safety
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A 'context' is thread safe and may be shared among as many application
threads as necessary, without any additional locking required on the part of
the caller.

Individual Crossroads 'sockets' are _not_ thread safe except in the case where
full memory barriers are issued when migrating a socket from one thread to
another. In practice this means applications can create a socket in one thread
with _xs_socket()_ and then pass it to a _newly created_ thread as part of
thread initialization, for example via a structure passed as an argument to
_pthread_create()_.


Multiple contexts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Multiple 'contexts' may coexist within a single application. Thus, an
application can use Crossroads directly and at the same time make use of any
number of additional libraries or components which themselves make use of
Crossroads as long as the above guidelines regarding thread safety are adhered
to.


Messages
~~~~~~~~
A Crossroads message is a discrete unit of data passed between applications or
components of the same application. Crossroads messages have no internal
structure and from the point of view of Crossroads themselves they are
considered to be opaque binary data.

The following functions are provided to work with messages:

Initialise a message::
    linkxs:xs_msg_init[3]
    linkxs:xs_msg_init_size[3]
    linkxs:xs_msg_init_data[3]

Release a message::
    linkxs:xs_msg_close[3]

Access message content::
    linkxs:xs_msg_data[3]
    linkxs:xs_msg_size[3]

Message manipulation::
    linkxs:xs_msg_copy[3]
    linkxs:xs_msg_move[3]


Sockets
~~~~~~~
Crossroads sockets present an abstraction of a asynchronous _message queue_,
with the exact queueing semantics depending on the socket type in use. See
linkxs:xs_socket[3] for the socket types provided.

The following functions are provided to work with sockets:

Creating a socket::
    linkxs:xs_socket[3]

Closing a socket::
    linkxs:xs_close[3]

Manipulating socket options::
    linkxs:xs_getsockopt[3]
    linkxs:xs_setsockopt[3]

Establishing a message flow::
    linkxs:xs_bind[3]
    linkxs:xs_connect[3]

Sending and receiving messages::
    linkxs:xs_send[3]
    linkxs:xs_recv[3]

.Input/output multiplexing
Crossroads provide a mechanism for applications to multiplex input/output events
over a set containing both Crossroads sockets and standard sockets. This
mechanism mirrors the standard _poll()_ system call, and is described in detail
in linkxs:xs_poll[3].


Transports
~~~~~~~~~~
A Crossroads socket can use multiple different underlying transport mechanisms.
Each transport mechanism is suited to a particular purpose and has its own
advantages and drawbacks.

The following transport mechanisms are provided:

Unicast transport using TCP::
    linkxs:xs_tcp[7]

Reliable multicast transport using PGM::
    linkxs:xs_pgm[7]

Local inter-process communication transport::
    linkxs:xs_ipc[7]

Local in-process (inter-thread) communication transport::
    linkxs:xs_inproc[7]

ERROR HANDLING
--------------
The Crossroads library functions handle errors using the standard conventions
found on POSIX systems. Generally, this means that upon failure a Crossroads
library function shall return either a NULL value (if returning a pointer) or
a negative value (if returning an integer), and the actual error code shall be
stored in the 'errno' variable.

On non-POSIX systems some users may experience issues with retrieving the
correct value of the 'errno' variable. The _xs_errno()_ function is provided
to assist in these cases; for details refer to linkxs:xs_errno[3].

The _xs_strerror()_ function is provided to translate Crossroads-specific error
codes into error message strings; for details refer to linkxs:xs_strerror[3].


MISCELLANEOUS
-------------
The following miscellaneous functions are provided:

Report Crossroads library version::
    linkxs:xs_version[3]


LANGUAGE BINDINGS
-----------------
The Crossroads library provides interfaces suitable for calling from programs in
any language; this documentation documents those interfaces as they would be
used by C programmers. The intent is that programmers using Crossroads from
other languages shall refer to this documentation alongside any documentation
provided by the vendor of their language binding.


ZEROMQ COMPATIBILITY
--------------------
The Crossroads library provides an optional drop-in 'libzmq' compatibility
library for ZeroMQ applications.  If your version of Crossroads was built with
the `--enable-libzmq` option, you can find the compatibility library
documentation in linkxs:zmq[7].
