xs_connect(3)
=============


NAME
----
xs_connect - connect a socket


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int xs_connect (void '*socket', const char '*endpoint');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _xs_connect()_ function shall connect the socket referenced by the
'socket' argument to the endpoint specified by the 'endpoint' argument.

The 'endpoint' argument is a string consisting of two parts as follows:
'transport'`://`'address'. The 'transport' part specifies the underlying
transport protocol to use. The meaning of the 'address' part is specific to
the underlying transport protocol selected.

The following transports are defined:

'inproc':: local in-process (inter-thread) communication transport, see linkxs:xs_inproc[7]
'ipc':: local inter-process communication transport, see linkxs:xs_ipc[7]
'tcp':: unicast transport using TCP, see linkxs:xs_tcp[7]
'pgm', 'epgm':: reliable multicast transport using PGM, see linkxs:xs_pgm[7]

With the exception of 'XS_PAIR' sockets, a single socket may be connected to
multiple endpoints using _xs_connect()_, while simultaneously accepting
incoming connections from multiple endpoints bound to the socket using
_xs_bind()_. Refer to linkxs:xs_socket[3] for a description of the exact
semantics involved when connecting or binding a socket to multiple endpoints.

NOTE: The connection will not be performed immediately but as needed by the
library. Thus a successful invocation of _xs_connect()_ does not indicate that a
physical connection was or can actually be established.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _xs_connect()_ function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it
shall return `-1` and set 'errno' to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
The endpoint supplied is invalid.
*EPROTONOSUPPORT*::
The requested 'transport' protocol is not supported.
*ENOCOMPATPROTO*::
The requested 'transport' protocol is not compatible with the socket type.
*ETERM*::
The 'context' associated with the specified 'socket' was terminated.
*ENOTSOCK*::
The provided 'socket' was invalid.
*EMTHREAD*::
No I/O thread is available to accomplish the task.


EXAMPLE
-------
.Connecting a subscriber socket to an in-process and a TCP transport
----
/* Create a XS_SUB socket */
void *socket = xs_socket (context, XS_SUB);
assert (socket);
/* Connect it to an in-process transport with the address 'my_publisher' */
int rc = xs_connect (socket, "inproc://my_publisher");
assert (rc == 0);
/* Connect it to the host server001, port 5555 using a TCP transport */
rc = xs_connect (socket, "tcp://server001:5555");
assert (rc == 0);
