xs_ipc(7)
=========


NAME
----
xs_ipc - local inter-process transport


SYNOPSIS
--------
The inter-process transport passes messages between local processes using a
system-dependent IPC mechanism.

NOTE: The inter-process transport is currently only implemented on operating
systems that provide UNIX domain sockets.


ADDRESSING
----------
A Crossroads address string consists of two parts as follows:
'transport'`://`'endpoint'. The 'transport' part specifies the underlying
transport protocol to use, and for the inter-process transport shall be set to
`ipc`.  The meaning of the 'endpoint' part for the inter-process transport is
defined below.


Assigning a local address to a socket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When assigning a local address to a 'socket' using _xs_bind()_ with the 'ipc'
transport, the 'endpoint' shall be interpreted as an arbitrary string
identifying the 'pathname' to create. The 'pathname' must be unique within the
operating system namespace used by the 'ipc' implementation, and must fulfill
any restrictions placed by the operating system on the format and length of a
'pathname'.

Connecting a socket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When connecting a 'socket' to a peer address using _xs_connect()_ with the
'ipc' transport, the 'endpoint' shall be interpreted as an arbitrary string
identifying the 'pathname' to connect to.  The 'pathname' must have been
previously created within the operating system namespace by assigning it to a
'socket' with _xs_bind()_.


WIRE FORMAT
-----------
Not applicable.


EXAMPLES
--------
.Assigning a local address to a socket
----
/* Assign the pathname "/tmp/feeds/0" */
rc = xs_bind(socket, "ipc:///tmp/feeds/0");
assert (rc == 0);
----

.Connecting a socket
----
/* Connect to the pathname "/tmp/feeds/0" */
rc = xs_connect(socket, "ipc:///tmp/feeds/0");
assert (rc == 0);
