================


NAME
----

xs_setsockopt - set Crossroads socket options


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int xs_setsockopt (void '*socket', int 'option_name', const void '*option_value', size_t 'option_len');*

Caution: All options, with the exception of XS_SUBSCRIBE, XS_UNSUBSCRIBE and
XS_LINGER, only take effect for subsequent socket bind/connects.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _xs_setsockopt()_ function shall set the option specified by the
'option_name' argument to the value pointed to by the 'option_value' argument
for the Crossroads socket pointed to by the 'socket' argument. The 'option_len'
argument is the size of the option value in bytes.

The following socket options can be set with the _xs_setsockopt()_ function:


XS_SNDHWM: Set high water mark for outbound messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_SNDHWM' option shall set the high water mark for outbound messages on
the specified 'socket'. The high water mark is a hard limit on the maximum
number of outstanding messages the library shall queue in memory for any single
peer that the specified 'socket' is communicating with.

If this limit has been reached the socket shall enter an exceptional state and
depending on the socket type, the library shall take appropriate action such as
blocking or dropping sent messages. Refer to the individual socket descriptions
in linkxs:xs_socket[3] for details on the exact action taken for each socket
type.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: messages
Default value:: 1000
Applicable socket types:: all


XS_RCVHWM: Set high water mark for inbound messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_RCVHWM' option shall set the high water mark for inbound messages on
the specified 'socket'. The high water mark is a hard limit on the maximum
number of outstanding messages the libray shall queue in memory for any single
peer that the specified 'socket' is communicating with.

If this limit has been reached the socket shall enter an exceptional state and
depending on the socket type, the library shall take appropriate action such as
blocking or dropping sent messages. Refer to the individual socket descriptions
in linkxs:xs_socket[3] for details on the exact action taken for each socket
type.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: messages
Default value:: 1000
Applicable socket types:: all


XS_AFFINITY: Set I/O thread affinity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_AFFINITY' option shall set the I/O thread affinity for newly created
connections on the specified 'socket'.

Affinity determines which threads from the Crossroads I/O thread pool associated
with the socket's _context_ shall handle newly created connections.  A value of
zero specifies no affinity, meaning that work shall be distributed fairly among
all Crossroads I/O threads in the thread pool. For non-zero values, the lowest
bit corresponds to thread 1, second lowest bit to thread 2 and so on.  For
example, a value of 3 specifies that subsequent connections on 'socket' shall be
handled exclusively by I/O threads 1 and 2.

See also linkxs:xs_init[3] for details on allocating the number of I/O
threads for a specific _context_.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: uint64_t
Option value unit:: N/A (bitmap)
Default value:: 0
Applicable socket types:: N/A


XS_SUBSCRIBE: Establish message filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_SUBSCRIBE' option shall establish a new message filter on a 'XS_SUB'
socket. Newly created 'XS_SUB' sockets shall filter out all incoming messages,
therefore you should call this option to establish an initial message filter.

An empty 'option_value' of length zero shall subscribe to all incoming
messages. A non-empty 'option_value' shall subscribe to all messages beginning
with the specified prefix. Multiple filters may be attached to a single
'XS_SUB' socket, in which case a message shall be accepted if it matches at
least one filter.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: binary data
Option value unit:: N/A
Default value:: N/A
Applicable socket types:: XS_SUB


XS_UNSUBSCRIBE: Remove message filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_UNSUBSCRIBE' option shall remove an existing message filter on a
'XS_SUB' socket. The filter specified must match an existing filter previously
established with the 'XS_SUBSCRIBE' option. If the socket has several
instances of the same filter attached the 'XS_UNSUBSCRIBE' option shall remove
only one instance, leaving the rest in place and functional.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: binary data
Option value unit:: N/A
Default value:: N/A
Applicable socket types:: XS_SUB


XS_IDENTITY: Set socket identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_IDENTITY' option shall set the identity of the specified 'socket'.
Socket identity is used only by request/reply pattern. Namely, it can be used
in tandem with ROUTER socket to route messages to the peer with specific
identity.

Identity should be at least one byte and at most 255 bytes long. Identities
starting with binary zero are reserved for use by Crossroads infrastructure.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: binary data
Option value unit:: N/A
Default value:: NULL
Applicable socket types:: all


XS_RATE: Set multicast data rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_RATE' option shall set the maximum send or receive data rate for
multicast transports such as linkxs:xs_pgm[7] using the specified 'socket'.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: kilobits per second
Default value:: 100
Applicable socket types:: all, when using multicast transports


XS_RECOVERY_IVL: Set multicast recovery interval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_RECOVERY_IVL' option shall set the recovery interval for multicast
transports using the specified 'socket'. The recovery interval determines the
maximum time in milliseconds that a receiver can be absent from a multicast
group before unrecoverable data loss will occur.

CAUTION: Exercise care when setting large recovery intervals as the data
needed for recovery will be held in memory. For example, a 1 minute recovery
interval at a data rate of 1Gbps requires a 7GB in-memory buffer.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: milliseconds
Default value:: 10000
Applicable socket types:: all, when using multicast transports

XS_SNDBUF: Set kernel transmit buffer size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_SNDBUF' option shall set the underlying kernel transmit buffer size
for the 'socket' to the specified size in bytes.  A value of zero means leave
the OS default unchanged. For details please refer to your operating system
documentation for the 'SO_SNDBUF' socket option.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: bytes
Default value:: 0
Applicable socket types:: all


XS_RCVBUF: Set kernel receive buffer size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_RCVBUF' option shall set the underlying kernel receive buffer size for
the 'socket' to the specified size in bytes.  A value of zero means leave the
OS default unchanged. For details refer to your operating system documentation
for the 'SO_RCVBUF' socket option.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: bytes
Default value:: 0
Applicable socket types:: all


XS_LINGER: Set linger period for socket shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_LINGER' option shall set the linger period for the specified 'socket'.
The linger period determines how long pending messages which have yet to be
sent to a peer shall linger in memory after a socket is closed with
linkxs:xs_close[3], and further affects the termination of the socket's
context with linkxs:xs_term[3]. The following outlines the different
behaviours:

* The default value of '-1' specifies an infinite linger period. Pending
  messages shall not be discarded after a call to _xs_close()_; attempting to
  terminate the socket's context with _xs_term()_ shall block until all
  pending messages have been sent to a peer.

* The value of '0' specifies no linger period. Pending messages shall be
  discarded immediately when the socket is closed with _xs_close()_.

* Positive values specify an upper bound for the linger period in milliseconds.
  Pending messages shall not be discarded after a call to _xs_close()_;
  attempting to terminate the socket's context with _xs_term()_ shall block
  until either all pending messages have been sent to a peer, or the linger
  period expires, after which any pending messages shall be discarded.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: milliseconds
Default value:: -1 (infinite)
Applicable socket types:: all


XS_RECONNECT_IVL: Set reconnection interval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_RECONNECT_IVL' option shall set the initial reconnection interval for
the specified 'socket'.  The reconnection interval is the period the library
shall wait between attempts to reconnect disconnected peers when using
connection-oriented transports.

NOTE: The reconnection interval may be randomized by the library to prevent
reconnection storms in topologies with a large number of peers per socket.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: milliseconds
Default value:: 100
Applicable socket types:: all, only for connection-oriented transports


XS_RECONNECT_IVL_MAX: Set maximum reconnection interval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_RECONNECT_IVL_MAX' option shall set the maximum reconnection interval 
for the specified 'socket'.  This is the maximum period the library shall wait
between attempts to reconnect. On each reconnect attempt, the previous interval
shall be doubled untill XS_RECONNECT_IVL_MAX is reached. This allows for
exponential backoff strategy. Default value means no exponential backoff is
performed and reconnect interval calculations are only based on
XS_RECONNECT_IVL.

NOTE:  Values less than XS_RECONNECT_IVL will be ignored.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: milliseconds
Default value:: 0 (only use XS_RECONNECT_IVL)
Applicable socket types:: all, only for connection-oriented transports


XS_BACKLOG: Set maximum length of the queue of outstanding connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'XS_BACKLOG' option shall set the maximum length of the queue of
outstanding peer connections for the specified 'socket'; this only applies to
connection-oriented transports. For details refer to your operating system
documentation for the 'listen' function.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: connections
Default value:: 100
Applicable socket types:: all, only for connection-oriented transports.


XS_MAXMSGSIZE: Maximum acceptable inbound message size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Limits the size of the inbound message. If a peer sends a message larger than
XS_MAXMSGSIZE it is disconnected.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: uint64_t
Option value unit:: bytes
Default value:: 2^64-1
Applicable socket types:: all


XS_MULTICAST_HOPS: Maximum network hops for multicast packets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sets the time-to-live field in every multicast packet sent from this socket.
The default is 1 which means that the multicast packets don't leave the local
network.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: network hops
Default value:: 1
Applicable socket types:: all, when using multicast transports


XS_RCVTIMEO: Maximum time before a recv operation returns with EAGAIN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sets the timeout for receive operation on the socket. If the value is `0`,
_xs_recv(3)_ will return immediately, with a EAGAIN error if there is no
message to receive. If the value is `-1`, it will block until a message is
available. For all other values, it will wait for a message for that amount
of time before returning with an EAGAIN error.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: milliseconds
Default value:: -1 (infinite)
Applicable socket types:: all


XS_SNDTIMEO: Maximum time before a send operation returns with EAGAIN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sets the timeout for send operation on the socket. If the value is `0`,
_xs_send(3)_ will return immediately, with a EAGAIN error if the message
cannot be sent. If the value is `-1`, it will block until the message is sent.
For all other values, it will try to send the message for that amount of time
before returning with an EAGAIN error.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: milliseconds
Default value:: -1 (infinite)
Applicable socket types:: all


XS_IPV4ONLY: Use IPv4-only sockets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sets the underlying native socket type.  A value of `1` will use IPv4 sockets,
while the value of `0` will use IPv6 sockets. An IPv6 socket lets 
applications connect to and accept connections from both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts.

[horizontal]
Option value type:: int
Option value unit:: boolean
Default value:: 1 (true)
Applicable socket types:: all, when using TCP transports.
